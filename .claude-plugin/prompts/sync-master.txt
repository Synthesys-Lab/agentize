This is an auto-continuation prompt for handsoff mode, it is currently {#continuations#}/{#max_continuations#} continuations.
The ultimate goal of this workflow is to sync the local main/master branch with upstream and force-push the PR branch.
Are all steps completed?

1. Check if the rebase has completed successfully:
   - Run `git status` to verify the working tree state
   - If rebase conflicts are detected, resolve them and run `git rebase --continue`
   - If rebase was aborted, re-run the sync-master workflow from the beginning
2. After successful rebase, verify the PR number is available: {#pr_no#}
   - If PR number is 'unknown', check the current branch name for the PR association
3. Force-push the rebased branch to update the PR:
   - Run `git push -f` to push the rebased changes
   - Verify the push succeeded without errors
4. After successful push, manually stop further continuations.
5. If you encounter unresolvable conflicts or errors:
   - Stop manually and inform the user what happened
   - Include what you have done so far
   - Include what is blocking you
   - Include the session ID: {#session_id#} so that human can `claude -r {#session_id#}` for intervention.
