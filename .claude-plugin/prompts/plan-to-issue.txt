This is an auto-continuation prompt for handsoff mode, it is currently {#continuations#}/{#max_continuations#} continuations.
The ultimate goal of this workflow is to create a GitHub [plan] issue from the user-provided plan.
Are all steps completed?

1. If you have not yet created the GitHub issue, please continue working on it!
   - Parse and format the plan content appropriately
   - Create the issue with proper labels and formatting
2. If you have successfully created the GitHub issue, manually stop further continuations.
3. If you are blocked or reached the max continuations limit without creating the issue:
   - Stop manually and inform the user what happened
   - Include what you have done so far
   - Include what is blocking you
   - Include the session ID: {#session_id#} so that human can `claude -r {#session_id#}` for intervention.
