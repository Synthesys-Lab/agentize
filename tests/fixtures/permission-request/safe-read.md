# Test Fixture: safe-read.json

## Purpose
Mock permission request for testing safe read operations (Read tool) in the Claude Code permission hook system.

## Expected Behavior
Permission hook should auto-approve this request in hands-off mode as read operations are non-destructive and always safe.
