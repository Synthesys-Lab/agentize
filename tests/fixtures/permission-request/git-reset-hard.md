# Test Fixture: git-reset-hard.json

## Purpose
Mock permission request for testing destructive git reset --hard operations in the Claude Code permission hook system.

## Expected Behavior
Permission hook should block this request as hard resets are destructive and irreversible operations requiring manual approval.
