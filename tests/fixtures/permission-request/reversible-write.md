# Test Fixture: reversible-write.json

## Purpose
Mock permission request for testing reversible file write operations on non-main branches in the Claude Code permission hook system.

## Expected Behavior
Permission hook should auto-approve this request in hands-off mode as file writes on development branches are safe and reversible.
